A project of [Christopher Woodall](http://www.cjwoodall.com) and 
[BUILDS](http://www.builds.cc).

## Rev. A Logs

- 4 proven working, 5 broked... Not 100% sure why, doesn't seem to be a soldering issue. I could have hooked them up wrong somehow during testing, but this should only apply to 1 or 2.
- Holes for .1" spaced headers are a little small, widen for future revisions.
